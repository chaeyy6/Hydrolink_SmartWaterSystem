# Hydrolink: Smart Water Distribution System

## Project Overview
Hydrolink is a smart water distribution system that integrates **PHP**, **MySQL**, **IoT sensors**, **QR-code authentication**, and **blockchain-based secure transactions**. The system improves water accessibility, resource management, and transparency for stakeholders.

This project was developed by a team of **3 members** as part of our academic capstone at San Beda College Alabang.

## Objectives
- Develop a software prototype with real-time monitoring and secure transaction tracking.
- Build a hardware prototype with Arduino and IoT sensors.
- Implement QR code-based learning modules to promote community involvement.
- Reduce single-use plastics with a sustainable water-dispensing mechanism.
- Ensure system effectiveness, security, and scalability based on ISO standards.

## Technologies Used
- PHP (backend)
- MySQL (database)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)
- Arduino & IoT sensors (hardware integration)
- QR code system
- Blockchain (for secure transaction tracking)

## Features
- Real-time water monitoring dashboard
- Secure blockchain-based transaction backend
- User-friendly web interface
- QR code learning modules
- Biodegradable water containers

## My Contributions
- Created the **frontend interfaces** and **dashboard**  
- Implemented **data fetching and display** on the dashboard  
- Developed **key functionalities** such as user registration, application submission, and viewing applications for clients and sponsorships  
- Assisted in testing and debugging of the system

## Notes
This project was developed as an **academic capstone** for San Beda College Alabang.
